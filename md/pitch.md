You know how when you need something notarized, it’s such a hassle? You’ve got to find a notary, set up an appointment, gather all your paperwork, drive over there, and sometimes pay a pretty steep fee — all just to verify a document. Well, that’s exactly what we’re fixing with DocChain Digital Notary.

DocChain is all about making document notarization and authentication as easy as clicking a button from anywhere. You upload your document, and instead of driving downtown and sitting in someone’s office, our system uses the latest cryptographic technology to create a unique, secure fingerprint for it. That fingerprint goes on the Stellar blockchain, where it’s locked down and can’t be tampered with, so anyone can verify it anytime, from anywhere.

Basically, with DocChain, we’re getting rid of the middleman, saving time and money, and making notarization super accessible. Imagine being able to handle important docs as easily as sending an email—that’s the future we’re building.
